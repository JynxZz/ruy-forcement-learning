Run this command in your Terminal to setup the training :

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JynxZz/ruy-forcement-learning/master/.setup_rl.sh | sh && exec zsh
```

Normally all the directory is set up for the ruy-forcement-learning.

Now Run this following command in the project directory :

```bash
cd ~/code/ruy-forcement-learning/
make env && make install
```

Now we add the rom of the game to the path.
The vitrtual env is setup and the requirements are install in the repo.

New alias is setup :
